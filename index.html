              Reptiles, in common parlance, are a group of tetrapods with an ectothermic ('cold-blooded') metabolism and amniotic development. Living
              reptiles comprise four orders: Testudines (turtles), Crocodilia (crocodilians), Squamata (lizards and snakes), and Rhynchocephalia (the
              tuatara). As of May 2023, about 12,000 living species of reptiles are listed in the Reptile Database.

              Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 7,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well
              as most oceanic island chains. The group is paraphyletic since it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia, although some lizards are more
              closely related to these two excluded groups than they are to other lizards. Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few
              centimeters long to the 3-meter-long Komodo dragon.

              Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae) are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards with 200 species
              described as of June 2015. The members of this family are best known for their distinct range of colors, being capable of shifting to
              different hues and degrees of brightness.

              Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic,
              amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard
              ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis).
